  text: "I studied for about 3 years at one of the best design schools. I worked on about ten projects in the NID Master's program. Several projects have won awards, and in some projects I have given 200%. Therefore, by the end of 2019, I had a really solid portfolio of 4 projects. <br> In 2020, I joined Zeta. It took about a year and a half, during which I took part in many small and large projects. Some of them required immediate execution, and some took a long time, because they were very detailed. All this time I have not updated my site, but 2-3 projects from Zeta are worthy of being included in the portfolio. Now, when I look at my previous projects, I feel that they are outdated. And this, in my opinion, is good. They are outdated because they no longer reflect my skills properly. This indicates only one thing – growth. Previously, it was difficult for me to understand why most of the senior designers I knew did not have a public portfolio. I thought that the reason was that their works could not be made public while they were relevant. Perhaps this is one of the reasons, but I believe that there is a more serious reason. We just understand that the portfolio will quickly become outdated, and we don't want the Internet to have a wrong idea about our skills.",
